          Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of
          DC's Superman; although Kane frequently claimed sole creation credit,
          Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero
          into something more bat-like. The character received his own spin-off

          Though the initial announcement of the series drew mixed reactions,
          Batman Beyond went on to receive critical acclaim and a cult
          following. The show is said to explore the darker side of many Batman
          projects, playing on key elements such as emotions, personal
          relations, fear of the unknown, as well as cyberpunk and sci-fi themes
          such as the issues and dilemmas of innovation and technological and
          scientific progress affecting society, and the psychology of the
          character of Bruce Wayne. In addition, due to the titular character

            s a 1960s American live action television series, based on the DC
            comic book character of the same name. It stars Adam West as Bruce
            Wayne/Batman and Burt Ward as Dick Grayson/Robin â€“ two
            crime-fighting heroes who defend Gotham City from a variety of
            archvillains.[1][2] It is known for its camp style, upbeat theme
            music, and its intentionally humorous, simplistic morality (aimed at
            its largely teenage audience).
